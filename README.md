Thank you for the opportunity to apply for this apprenticeship.

To initialize the app please install the dependancies with 'npm install', then run 'node booksApi.js', the app will start from there.

Unfortunately I got confused from the email at the statement "You do not have to use a private GitHub repo for this."
I thought that meant that I wasn't to use a github repo at all, as opposed to a private one specifically.
I learned otherwise when I eventually checked the submission link, which was after I had pretty much finished the app.

About the testing. I was unable to get testing to work with the app I made, unfortunately. I was going to spend tomorrow working on it. However a family medical emergency has come up, so I will be unable to continue to work on this tomorrow, hence why I am submitting it now, at 10:30pm est the night before.

I look forward to your feedback.
