Thank you for the opportunity to apply for this apprenticeship.

This app uses node version: 17.3.0
To initialize the app please install the dependancies with 'npm install', then run 'node booksApi.js', the app will start from there.

Unfortunately I got confused from the email at the statement "You do not have to use a private GitHub repo for this."
I thought that meant that I wasn't to use a github repo at all, as opposed to a private one specifically.
I learned otherwise when I eventually checked the submission link, which was after I had pretty much finished the app.

About the testing. I was unable to get testing to work with the app I made, unfortunately. I was going to spend tomorrow working on it. However a family medical emergency has come up, so I will be unable to continue to work on this tomorrow, hence why I am submitting it now, at 10:30pm est the night before.

I look forward to your feedback.
